title: Comparing GDevelop and Polytoria
description: Main difference between Polytoria and GDevelop
---

# Programming Language

GDevelop uses a Event-based visual programming language, and Polytoria uses a customized version of[Lua](https://lua.org), a multiparadigm programming language. I know it sounds scary, but it is not! It's a piece of cake to learn Lua.

# From 2D to 3D

In GDevelop, you develop games in 2D, but in Polytoria you develop games in 3D, here are the main differences:

- It's not X, Y anymore, it's X, Y, Z.
- In GDevelop you can draw your own sprites, in Polytoria you can build your own sprites, and imagination is the limit!

# Easy Multiplayer

In Polytoria, multiplayer is already featured on your project, no need to setup anything. You can select how many players can play in one server, whitelist who can play the game, and publish to more than 20k+ players.

# Vibrant and helpful community!

In Polytoria, you have a helpful community ready to support you in case of a bug, error, etc...
