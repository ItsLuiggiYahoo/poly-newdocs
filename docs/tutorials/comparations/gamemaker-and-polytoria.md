# Using objects

In GameMaker you use Objects and Sprites to make elements in your game, In Polytoria, you use Parts and Models to make your game. Like the Pixel Editor in GameMaker, in Polytoria you can also build your elements, script them, and if you want to, publish them into our marketplace!

# Simpler and Fast Interface

Different from GameMaker, Polytoria Creator's interface is simpler, but very powerful, because every action is a click of a button away, making development faster.

# Programming Language

GameMaker uses GML as it's main language, Polytoria uses a customized version of [Lua](https://lua.org). GML and Lua are different, but easy languages, both you can learn in a evening.

GML is a dinamically typed language like JavaScript and C-like languages, Lua is a Multiparadigm language, it is the same language that Roblox developers use to make games. [^1]
