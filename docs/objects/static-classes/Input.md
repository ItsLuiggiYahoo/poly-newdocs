### ScreenToViewportPoint(screenPosition;Vector3):Vector3 { method }

Transforms `screenPosition` parameter from screen space into viewport space.

### ScreenToWorldPoint(screenPosition;Vector3):Vector3 { method }

Transforms `screenPosition` from screen space into world space.

<div data-search-exclude markdown>
!!! note "World space coordinates can still be calculated even when provided as an off-screen coordinate."
</div>

Transforms `viewportPosition` from viewport space into screen space.

### ViewportToWorldPoint(viewportPosition;Vector3):Vector3 { method }

Transforms `viewportPosition` from viewport space into world space.

<div data-search-exclude markdown>
!!! note "ViewportToWorldPoint transforms an x-y screen position into a x-y-z position in 3D space."
</div>
