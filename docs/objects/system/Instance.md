```lua
game["Environment"].ChildAdded:Connect(function (child)
    print(child.Name .. " was added")
end)
```

### ChildRemoved(child;Instance) { event }

Fires when a child instance is removed.

**Example**

```lua
game["Environment"].ChildRemoved:Connect(function (child)
    print(child.Name .. " was removed")
end)
```

### Clicked(player;Player) { event }

Fires when the instance is clicked by a player.

**Example**

```lua
game["Environment"]["Part"].Clicked:Connect(function (player)
    print(player.Name .. " clicked on this part!")
end)
```

### MouseEnter { event }

Fires when the mouse enters the instance.

**Example**

```lua
part.MouseEnter:Connect(function()
    part.Color = Color.New(1, 0, 0)
end)
```

### MouseExit { event }

Fires when the mouse enters the instance.

**Example**

```lua
part.MouseExit:Connect(function()
    part.Color = Color.New(0, 1, 0)
end)
```

### Touched(otherPart;Instance) { event }

Fires when the instance was touched by another instance.

**Example**

```lua
game["Environment"]["Part"].Touched:Connect(function (otherPart)
    print(otherPart.Name .. " touched this part!")
end)
```

<div data-search-exclude markdown>
!!! note "There must be an active collider on the instance for this event to trigger ({{ classLink("Part") }}, {{ classLink("Player") }}, etc.)"
</div>

### TouchEnded(otherPart;Instance) { event }

Fires when the instance is no longer being touched by another instance.

**Example**

```lua
game["Environment"]["Part"].TouchEnded:Connect(function (otherPart)
    print(otherPart.Name .. " stopped touching this part!")
end)
```

<div data-search-exclude markdown>
!!! note "There must be an active collider on the instance for this event to trigger ({{ classLink("Part") }}, {{ classLink("Player") }}, etc.)"
</div>

### FindChild(name;string):Instance { method }

Attempts to find the first child instance with the specified name (`nil` if not found).

### FindChildByClass(className;string):Instance { method }

Attempts to find the first child instance with the specified class (`nil` if not found).

### GetChildren:Instance[] { method }

Returns an array of all the children instances parented to the instance.

### GetChildrenOfClass(className;string):Instance[] { method }

Returns an array of all the children instances with the specified class.

## Properties

### CanReparent:bool { property }

Returns whether this instance can be reparented/deleted or not.

### ClassName:string { property }

### Item:Instance { property }

Specifies the name of an instance.

### Name:string { property }

Specifies the name of an instance.

### Parent:Instance { property }

<div data-search-exclude markdown>
!!! note "Shared doesn't sync from the client to the server, or from the server to the client."
</div>

**Example**

```lua
-- Script 1
local players = game.Players.GetChildren()
local lucky = players[math.random(1, #players)]

lucky.Shared.IsZombie = true
```

```lua
-- Script 2
local killBrick = game.Environment["Kill Brick"]

killBrick.Touched:Connect(function(hit)
    if hit.IsA("Player") then
        if hit.Shared.IsZombie then
            print("YOU CAN'T KILL ME, I'M ALREADY DEAD!")
